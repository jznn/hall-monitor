# hall-monitor
Collection of Bash scripts used to monitor red team activity in the form of spawned processes, network connections, and systemd services. Attempts to streamline the process of reading through logs and other acts of reconnaisance.

to-do:
  find a better name for the project
  make the scripts print when it detects potentially malicious activity (many new processes spawned, new connections, etc.)
  complete portions for network connections, new user logins, systemd services
